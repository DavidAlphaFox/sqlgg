* allow to parametrize SQL syntax itself (ORDER BY ASC|DESC) : unsafe and enumeration
* allow to tolerate errors in query
* special code for queries returning single values (COUNT(*) and the like)
* decide what to do with unquoted identifiers matching keywords
* provide ways to extend lexer with tokens in runtime
* split overview into several pages
* some database API are inadequately strict about data types (notably ADO.NET), need native-type annotations in queries
* choose better names for some common cases (WHERE id = ? etc)
* fix line numbers in error output
* enhance error reporting
* calculate types more precisely, type-inferrer is too primitive
* detect statements on single tables and group the corresponding generated code together
* check function names for uniqueness
* support/test other SQL engines
* generate code for more languages
* read SQL spec
* distinguish predicates and expressions
* type check expressions
