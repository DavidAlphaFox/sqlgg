* write tutorial (for all languages), start documentation
* native-type annotations in queries
* output params syntax for different DB
* guarantee correct duplicate params usage
* allow to parametrize SQL syntax itself (ORDER BY ASC|DESC) : unsafe and enumeration
* camlp4 syntax extension for inline sql
* allow to tolerate errors in query
* detect single-row queries (COUNT(*) without GROUP BY (done), LIMIT 1 (done), SELECT and UNIQUE INDEX, SELECT const without WHERE (done))
* support BULK INSERTs (how?)
* decide what to do with unquoted identifiers matching keywords
* provide ways to extend lexer with tokens in runtime
* choose better names for some common cases (WHERE id = ? etc)
* fix line numbers in error output
* enhance error reporting
* calculate types more precisely, type-inferrer is too primitive
* verify that each parameter gets one type inferred
* track NULLs
* detect statements on single tables and group the corresponding generated code together
* use prepared statements in all traits
* check function names for uniqueness
* support/test other SQL engines
* generate code for more languages
* read SQL spec
* distinguish predicates and expressions
* type check expressions
