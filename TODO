* choose better names for some common cases (WHERE id = ? etc)
* type-inferrer is to primitive
* detect statements on single tables and group the corresponding generated code in one class
* check names (functions and bindings) for uniqueness
* support/test other SQL engines
* generate code for more languages
* read SQL spec
* SQL (as understood by sqlite3 at least) is really too permissive, decide what to do
* type check expressions
